# Quiz Application
A simple quiz application that teaches the concepts of "console io", "reading from csv", "goroutines" and "channels".

## Problem statement:
https://github.com/gophercises/quiz/tree/solution-p2

## Notes
Because of my misunderstanding of the challenge, I also implemented a timeout for the individual questions,
and it thought me how to handle input coming from a goroutine.
